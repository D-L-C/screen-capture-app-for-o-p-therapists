Originally created for a client that wanted an app that was meant to capture a screenshot of a patient signature then uploaded to a server. This app has the ability to set a time and date watermark to go along with the screen capture. This app was meant to go a long with hipaa ruling. This app was never deployed and development was focused else where. Its a working alpha.
